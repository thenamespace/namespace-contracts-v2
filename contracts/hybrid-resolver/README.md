# Contract Overview: L2 ENS Subname minting 

High-level contract overview for implementing ENS Subname minting on different L2 chains (Base, Optimims, etc.).


## NamespaceMintController 

[0x5C1220C4C5D75aC2d0A2f893995b5eCec98F3Aa6](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x5C1220C4C5D75aC2d0A2f893995b5eCec98F3Aa6)

Central authority for managing subname operations under deployed registries. 

Responsible for:

- **Minting Subnames**: Creates new subnames within specific registries, ensuring all required conditions are met.
- **Registry Deployment**: Oversees the deployment of new mint registries, allowing custom namespaces.
- **Expiry Management**: Provides functionality to extend the expiration of existing subnames.

## NamePublicResolver** 

[0xD8de4F5D7117BA37bA171ec9180Da798056f2CEd](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0xd8de4f5d7117ba37ba171ec9180da798056f2ced)

A streamlined adaptation of the ENS Public Resolver contract designed to handle name record management efficiently on Optimism. 

Responsible for:
- **Record Storage**: Maintains mappings for subnames, such as addresses, content hashes, or other key data.

## NodeResolver 

[0xD8de4F5D7117BA37bA171ec9180Da798056f2CEd](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0xd8de4f5d7117ba37ba171ec9180da798056f2ced)

A specialized contract for resolving the corresponding ERC721 registry for any given name or subname. 

Responsible for:

- **Registry Mapping**: Identify and link names to their respective ERC721 contracts.
- **Subname Navigation**: Enable seamless lookups for subnames within the system.

## Emitter 

[0x87516b5518a6548433ab97ae59b15b1a31472f11](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x87516b5518a6548433ab97ae59b15b1a31472f11)

This contract provides a unified mechanism for logging events across all deployed registries. 

Responsible for:

- Standardize Event Emission: Ensure all registries follow a consistent format for emitting events, simplifying tracking and monitoring.
- Support Interoperability: Facilitate integration with external tools and systems by providing a common event structure.

## ENSNameRegistry

An ERC721-compliant registry contract designed to store subnames as NFTs. This ensures secure and transparent ownership. Key aspects include:

- Subname as NFTs: Each subname is represented as an NFT, inheriting the benefits of blockchain-based ownership, including transferability and immutability.
- Compatibility: Fully supports ERC721 standards, allowing seamless integration with wallets, marketplaces, and other blockchain tools.
